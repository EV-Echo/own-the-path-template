This is your personal space to explore, learn, and build confidence in who you are and what you want to become.  
Every folder and file here is designed to help you set goals, reflect on your growth, and showcase your progress over time.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Intro to who you are and what you're working toward |
| `goals.md` | Track your short-term and long-term SMART goals |
| `log.md` | Weekly or monthly journal of progress, wins, and lessons |
| `assessment-results.md` | Results from personality/career tests |
| `/projects/` | Folder for creative work, files, videos, designs, etc. |

## ✍️ How to Start

1. Edit your `README.md` and introduce yourself.
2. Take at least one self-assessment (see `assessment-results.md`) and write your thoughts.
3. Add one goal to `goals.md`.
4. Start building something — anything — and document it in `/projects/`.

> This is your journey. You own the path forward. Let's go.
